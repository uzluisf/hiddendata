# Instructions
The following visualization gives you the ability to look at the overall rates of stop, question, and frisk actions by the NYPD in New York City from 2003 to 2016.  On the right hand side of the home page, you can select a preferred age range and sex in order to see the rate of stops by race/ethnicity for each year.  Users can hover over any of the black dots on the graph to see the rate for each race/ethnicity for that year.

On the left hand side, you can look at an overall map of the City, broken out by police precinct, to see how the total number of stops in each precinct compared to one another.  The map portion of this visualization gives you the ability to zoom in on any area of the city in order to see the exact location of every stop conducted by the NYPD over the course of a given year.

To view the exact coordinates of stops:
  -	Zoom in on the map by double-clicking, or scrolling with a mouse
    -	The color overlaying each precinct will disappear once you have zoomed in enough
  -	Click inside the precinct of interest 
    -	The precinct that you selected will be outlined in blue
    -	After clicking, a graph displaying the number of stops by year will appear to the right of the map
    -	Hover over each bar to view the number of stops in a given year
  -	Click the bar on the graph corresponding to the year in which you would like to see
    -	After clicking, a series of blue dots will appear on the map
    -	Each dot represents a stop
    -	You will see a slider above the graph on the right hand side that indicates on what day of the year the stops on the left hand side       occurred
    -	Click inside the precinct again to stop the visualization on that day
    -	Click on the highlighted bar again to remove the stops from the screen

If you would like to go back to the overall rate graph by race/ethnicity and year, click outside the boundaries of any of the precincts (water or outside of the City boundaries).
